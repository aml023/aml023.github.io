            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>Our team of 4 Human-Computer Interaction students were tasked with working with a local client to redesign their website to better fit their user needs. We found LC Spa, a local spa near the UCSD campus that was able to retain customers, but was failing to bring in lots of new customers. After speaking with the owner, Jennifer, she was ecstatic to have us help her reimagine the website for her business. We approached this project with hopes to understand the thought process behind choosing a new spa.</p>
                <p>In this project, I was responsible for user research, wireframing, graphic design, and development. In addition to that, I went in for several onsite meetings to take pictures of the spa and staff for the website. </p>

                <p>We began with a deep dive into the current LC Spa website to gain some initial insights that would provide as talking points for user research and with our client.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Right off the bat, we noticed the branding of the site. While it was consistent, it did not convey the look and feel of a spa. Nevertheless, we found that a lot of the functionality was there, but the information architecture had clear room for improvement.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Being unfamiliar with spas and their websites, we wanted to compare and contrast several competitor sites before heading in the wrong direction.  We split up our findings into several sections: Branding, Content, Functionality, Site Architecture, Navigation, and Design. Each section points out specific parts of the four sites and shows what we want to avoid and what we want to use as inspiration. At the end of each section, we quickly bullet pointed our ideas. <a href="img/lcspa/spacompanalysis.pdf">Click here to see our deck.</a></p>

                <p>We asked Jennifer what her customer demographics were, and she told us that there was a lot of variation, but overall, more women than men, and the men that came in were generally young adults. With this information, we interviewed 9 people, that fit into one of our three personas: Young Women (Ages 18-30), Older Women (Ages 30-60), and Young Men (Age 20-30). Within these personas, we made sure to interview people who have been to spas, and those who have not. We asked them to guide us through the process by which they find spas to go to, and their needs as spa-goers. We also showed them several spa websites, including LC Spas old website.<a href="img/lcspa/User%20Interviews.pdf"> You can see our in-depth user research here.</a></p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>After reviewing several spa websites, we set up a client meeting to go over our findings and define our clients objectives. Jennifer's main goal was to bring in more first-time customers. She believes that once they experience the quality, they'll come back for more. We found in our user interviews that the leading determinant of whether or not someone tried a spa was based on that spas reputation, primarily on <b>Yelp</b>. When users go on Yelp, they look at pictures, reviews, and the company website. We urged Jennifer to allow us to help her rebrand the website (logo and color-scheme) to be more friendly and inviting, which we believed would help bring in more new users. We also informed her about the different needs for different demographics, and suggested creating a website that appealed to all people. We found that some spa websites felt overly feminine, some overly extravagant, and we did not want to make some people feel unwelcomed. We agreed to make the website as neutral and inclusive as possible, while still conveying the spas feelings of relaxation, serenity, and comfort. <b>How might we create a website that extends the feeling of LC Spa to potential users?</b></p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>Our group wanted to get an aesthetic feel for the site, so we worked to develop brand package examples for Jennifer to look at and point us in the direction she wanted. We paired several fonts with several color palettes, and even made a few logos. She ended up mixing and matching to find the combination she liked best. <a href="img/lcspa/LC%20Spa%20Brand%20Package.pdf"> You can take a look at our brand package here.</a></p>
                <p>With branding settled, we began development by sketching out the architecture of the entire site, focusing on page navigation and content placement. Perhaps the most important architectural decision that we made was to take out the "Before and After" Page that was included in the original website. From our user interviews, we found that it was too off-putting, and did not look professional. It also did not display clear "before and after" results.</p>
                <div align="center">
                    <a href="img/lcspa/beforeandafterog1.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-title="Before and After 1/2" data-gallery="bna">

                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>Jennifer had previously emphasized the importance in the quality of the products they use, so we decided to replace the "Before and After" page with a "What We Use" Page. We tested both pages with potential users, and found that they both presented a similar testament to the quality of the spas services, but the new page was less off-putting.</p>
                <div align="center">
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/lcspa/homepages.jpg" style="max-height: 350px; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px ">
                </div>
                <p>Next, we moved on to wireframing in Sketch and Figma. Once we started converting our sketches to digital frames, we noticed that a lot of our sketched did not fit on a digital scale, so we had to reorganize some of the content. Once we finished the wireframes, we prototyped them in Invision and found some minor user flow errors. For example, we had a "Book Now" button next to every service, to make it easier for users to book a service, but that button just linked to the general booking page. Many users wanted that to go one step further and automatically lead to the booking page for that specific service. <a href="img/lcspa/Wireframes%20and%20Functional%20Spec.pdf">If you want to see our wireframes, click here.</a></p>

                </div>
                <p>The last step was to convert our sketches and frames into code. We developed our website using a Bootstrap template, so that the site would be responsive. Then, we used many flexboxes to frame the content.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Our top user needs required our website to be <b>accessible</b> for people of all ages and genders. Therefore, we designed the website to be simple and straightforward, easy for anyone to understand, with an enticing look that feels warm and welcoming. For example, we made sure to include the hours and of operation on the home page, and made the navbar accessible at all times. We took into consideration the needs of all types of users, and meshed them together so that nothing is made too obviously catered to a particular user group. We also kept a few features from the original website, such as automatic links to Google and Apple Maps, while adding new ones. To add site credibility, we placed actual Yelp reviews onto the home page. As previously mentioned, we placed an intuitive "Book Now" call-to-action on every service offered, as well as in the navbar. <a href="http://www.lcspasandiego.com/index.html">Click here to visit the live website.</a></p>

                Initially, this project was daunting, not only in scope, but the mere fact that I had no knowledge of spas to begin with. After a lot of research, including a competitive analysis and interviews, I was able to grasp what a spa website should look like. As the only male on the project team, I was also able to empathize with the male persona, and give my own opinion on what I would look for if I were to consider going to a spa. This was the most complete project that I have worked on, and it truly is amazing to see how far we came in just 8 weeks. Our client contract stated that there were no guarantees on behalf of either party, but we're proud to announce that we were successful in that, LC Spa has decided to use our website as opposed to their original. After surveying several first time customers, we have confirmed that this site has been successful in attracting new users.
