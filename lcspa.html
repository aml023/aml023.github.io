            <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">We were tasked with finding a local client and offering to design a website or redesign their current one for their business within a ten-week period. Our diverse group of four students spoke to several possible clients before choosing to work with LC Spa. We noticed <a href="http://www.lcspasandiego.com/">their current website</a> and saw a lot of improvement. Additionally, we were intrigued by their enthusiasm and willingness to communicate, making them the perfect client.</p>

            <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">We visited LC Spa to further understand their site goals and objectives. Our client wanted us to rebrand their website, including the logo and color scheme, to better match the aesthetic of the spa itself. They wanted us to prioritize ease of access to information regarding treatments and booking. Overall, they wanted us to extend the experience of their spa to their website users in an effort to gain more credibility and attract new and returning customers. While there, I took several photos that we could possibly use on the site, but primarily as references for the physical site that we will be trying to emulate on the website.  We also asked them what their customers are like, which resulted in three personas: younger women (ages 18-30), older women (ages 30+), and men. We took this into consideration during the next phase: user research. </p>

              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">With the information from our client interview, we interviewed 9 people that fit into one of the three personas. We asked them to talk about their previous spa experiences, what they look for in a spa, and what sort of atmosphere they imagine at a nice spa. We discovered that the three personas had vastly different objectives. Younger women tended to look for an even ratio of quality and cost, where they will sacrifice quality for a cheaper price, whereas older women were more willing to spend a lot of money for a quality spa treatment. Men, on the other hand, had several concerns when looking to go to a spa. They want to feel comfortable in the space. In most cases, the primary users at spas are women, so men may feel more uneasy when attending a spa for the first time. We wanted to ensure that our design and branding were gender-neutral and felt welcoming to all. From this information, we compiled a list of possible use cases and features that our website should contain. <a href="User%20Interviews.pdf">You can see our lists and in-depth interviews here.</a>

            <h2 class="heading">Branding</h2>
            <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">The site's current branding does not give the spa good credibility. The colors are dark and the images used do not convey relaxation like a spa should. We put together a few quick combinations of colors, fonts, and logos to show our client and get a better feel for the type of brand they wanted to be. After showing them the options we suggested, we asked them what they liked and disliked about each combination. In the end, we were able to mix and match between-groups to develop a final brand package. <a href="LC%20Spa%20Brand%20Package.pdf">If you want to see our initial brand package, click here.</a></p>

            <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">Next, we dove into sketching out what the website should look, prioritizing mobile design and then desktop. We thought about what functions we needed to have and put our initial placements on paper. This served as an anchor and starting point for our wireframes. We developed low resolution mobile wireframes collaboratively on Figma, but decided to work on the desktop wireframes on Sketch. Once we put the sketches onto a digital mockup, we realized that our ideas did not actually mesh well with the mobile interface, so we had to iterate upon our initial ideas. <a href="sketches.pdf">If you want to see all of our wireframes, take a look here.</a></p>

              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">We moved onto coding our actual project using Bootstrap. <a href="https://emyng95.github.io/spatacular-new/index.html">Our final prototype can be found here,</a> which can be compared to their <a href="http://www.lcspasandiego.com/">original website here.</a> Our top user needs required our website to be accessible for people of all ages. We had two primary user groups: females between 18-30 and females between 30-60. We also had a secondary user group, being men. When focusing on young females, we found that their main goals were to see the services offered, how much they cost, and what the place looks like. For older women, we found that they care less about the price, as long as they know that the services they are getting are quality.  For men, they do not want to go to a place that is too feminine and will help them figure out what kind of services would work best for them. For all of our user groups, there is a need for site credibility. They want to go to a professional spa that offers top-quality services for a good price, and they find these places online through Yelp reviews or website research.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">Initially, this project was daunting, not only in scope, but the mere fact that I have no experience or knowledge with spas ot begin with. After a lot of research, including a competitive analysis and interviews, I was able to grasp what a spa website should look like. As the only male on the project team, I was also able to empathize with the male persona, and give my own opinion on what I would look for if I were to consider going to a spa. This was the most complete project that I have worked on, and it truly is amazing to see how far we came in just 10 weeks. Our client contract states that neither party is guaranteed a finished product, but moving forward, we would like to continue to work with LC Spa to properly host their website on their domain. </p>
