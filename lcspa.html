            <h2 class="heading">Summary</h2>
            <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">Our group of 4 design students worked with a local client, LC Spa, to help rebrand and redesign their website to bring in more first-time users. We noticed their current website and saw a lot of room for improvement. Additionally, we were intrigued by their enthusiasm and willingness to communicate, making them the perfect client to work with.  Our contract stated that the client was not guaranteed a finished, satisfactory website, as we were students working on the project for free, but they ended up loving our work, and began hosting our site in June, 2018.</p>

              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">We first approached this challenge by analyzing the site we were working with, to gain some initial insights that would provide as bases for user research and talking points with our client. We started with the homepage and found that, from a usability standpoint, the site does a lot of things right, but there was clearly room for improvement. Right off the bat, we can see that the homepage has a clear navigation column and the user can see featured treatments, hours, and location (they even included links to the Google and Apple Maps!). Content-wise, the site is OK, but there are some visual design and information architecture flaws. Although the site does utilize some sort of grid, it is not pixel perfect and results in a sloppy vibe. There is also a call-to-action in the "Schedule Now" button, but the button itself looks off-brand, and is not prioritized enough. Lastly, the sites brand does not give off the feel of a relaxation and serenity. The dark tones are not what one would expect when viewing a spa website.</p>

                            <a href="img/LCSPAogserv1.png" title="Services Page" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="ogserv" data-title="Services Page" data-footer=""><img src="img/LCSPAogserv1.png" class="img-responsive image" style="max-height: 450px; width: auto; margin-bottom: 25px;"></a>
                            <div class="middle">

                    </div>
                </div>
              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">Next up was the Services Page. This page would be the second-most important of the site, as we assumed people would like to see what was offered, what they entailed, and the cost. Again, the content was there, but it needed some reorganizing. It had a sort of filter system that got the job done, but lacked structure. It was a nice touch adding a call-to-action at the end of every service offered, but they all linked to the same "Contact Us" page. The question for us here was, would people rather call in to learn more about the services and schedule on the phone, or would they rather be linked straight to the scheduling app?</p>

                </div>
              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">The last page analysis I will include will be the "Before and After" page, mainly because of how off-putting it is. Showing before and after photos is a great way to present results, but in this case, the imagery does not work. The very first image the user sees is a lady with her eyes blurred out (for privacy reasons, we assumed). Not only are the before and after images taken with different camera settings (one with flash and one without), the blurred eyes are a bit frightening. This, in combination with the dark color scheme, do not mesh well. Scrolling down the site, all of the before and after photosets are formatted differently, again giving off a sloppy vibe.</p>

              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">After reviewing the website, we visited LC Spa to further understand their sites goals and objectives. Aesthetically, our client wanted us to rebrand their website, including the logo and color scheme, to better match the aesthetic of the spa itself. Functionally, they wanted us to prioritize ease of access to information regarding treatments and booking. Their previous website was intimidating and uninviting at first glance, so <b>our challenge was to convey a friendly atmosphere through the website to give them more credibility and bring in more first-time users.</b>  They believe that once a customer has experienced their high-quality services, they'll definitely return for more.  While there, I took several photos of the spa to use as references for the physical site that we will be trying to emulate online.</p>

              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">Throughout several emails and meetings, we asked our client what their customers are like, which resulted in three personas: younger women (ages 18-30), older women (ages 30+), and men. We used this as a guide for our user research. We proceeded to interview 9 people that fit into one of the three personas. We asked them to talk about their previous spa experiences, what they look for in a spa, and what sort of atmosphere they imagine at a premium spa. We discovered that the three personas had vastly different objectives. Younger women tended to look for an even ratio of quality and cost, where they will sacrifice quality for a cheaper price, whereas older women were more willing to spend a lot of money for a quality spa treatment. Men, on the other hand, had several concerns when looking to go to a spa. They want to feel comfortable in the space. In most cases, the primary users at spas are women, so men may feel more uneasy when attending a spa for the first time. We wanted to ensure that our design and branding were gender-neutral and felt welcoming to all. From this information, we compiled a list of possible use cases and features that our website should contain. <a href="User%20Interviews.pdf">You can see our lists and in-depth interviews here.</a>

            <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">At the time, the site's branding was it's major flaw. The colors were dark and the images scared possible customers rather than enticing them. The branding of the new website was vital to it's success.  With such a wide variety of users, we didn't want to scare off anyone.  A decision was made to ensure that the branding was not overly feminine, such that some people might believe that this is not the place for them.  We wanted everyone to feel welcome.  We put together a few quick combinations of colors, fonts, and logos to show our client and get a better feel for what their taste was like. After showing them the options we suggested, we asked them what they liked and disliked about each combination. In the end, we were able to mix and match between-groups to develop a final brand package. <a href="LC%20Spa%20Brand%20Package.pdf">If you want to see our initial brand package, click here.</a></p>

            <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">Next, we dove into sketching out what the website should look, prioritizing mobile design followed by desktop. We thought about what functions we needed to have and put our initial placements on paper. For example, we wanted a link the universal booking tool available in the menu, thereby becoming accessible at any time.  Additionally, we found that some first-time users did not know what many of the services consisted of, so we wanted each service description to have it's own "Book Now" button that would allow the user to easily book a specific type of service after reading the description.  These quick sketches of ideas served as an anchor and starting point for our wireframes. We developed low resolution mobile wireframes collaboratively on Figma, but decided to work on the desktop wireframes in Sketch. Once we put the sketches onto a digital mockup, we realized which of our ideas meshed well with the mobile interface and which ones did not. Upon serveral iterations, we created more concrete frames.  <a href="sketches.pdf">If you want to see all of our wireframes, take a look here.</a></p>

              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">We moved onto coding our actual project using a Bootstrap template. <a href="http://www.lcspasandiego.com/">Our final prototype can be found here.</a> Our top user needs required our website to be accessible for people of all ages. The design is simple enough for anyone to understand, with an enticing look that feels warm and welcoming.  We took into consideration the needs of all types of users, and meshed them together so that nothing is made too obviously catered to a particular user group.  Iterations upon our research and wireframes, as well as many hours put into finding unique ways to code particular aspects of our site resulted in a beautiful finished product.</p>

              <p class="lead margin-bottom--big">Initially, this project was daunting, not only in scope, but the mere fact that I have no experience or knowledge with spas to begin with. After a lot of research, including a competitive analysis and interviews, I was able to grasp what a spa website should look like. As the only male on the project team, I was also able to empathize with the male persona, and give my own opinion on what I would look for if I were to consider going to a spa. This was the most complete project that I have worked on, and it truly is amazing to see how far we came in just 10 weeks. Our client contract stated that there were no guarantees on behalf of either party, but we're proud to announce that we were successful in that, LC Spa has decided to use our website as opposed to their original.  After surveying several first time customers, we have confirmed that this site has been successful in attracting new users.</p>
