            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>Our group of four human-computer interaction students was tasked with redesigning a music streaming app, focusing on playlist management and creation. The majority of this process was dedicated to research, starting with needfinding and followed by an in-depth competitive analysis of three major music apps: Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music. Our goal was to evaluate the pros and cons of each app and use that to guide us as we attempted to redesign the user flow of playlist creation and management.</p>
                <p>In this project, I was responsible for user research, conducting a competitive analysis, ideation, wireframing, and prototyping.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>We wanted to gain some initial insights to guide our research, so we started off by interviewing people who we knew used some sort of music streaming app: <b>college students</b>. We wanted to understand what music app they use, how they chose to use it (over the competitors), when they use it, and how they utilize specific features, particularly creating and managing playlists.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We found that a majority of our sample used Spotify, followed by Apple Music, and then SoundCloud. Most of which explained that their decision to use that app was primarily due to price, or already having a free account and then deciding to subscribe for premium access. There were three standout usage scenarios: when studying, driving, and partying. Almost all of our sample described creating playlists as a process that took getting used to, but masterful over time. We found that most playlists were created for three scenarios: studying, driving, and partying.</p>
                <p>We decided to delve deeper into the three streaming apps our sample used: Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud. We analyzed the user flows of playlist creation and management of all three apps, attempting to understand the what makes some functions easier than others. We narrowed creating playlists down to three user paths: creating playlists from the menu, from the current song playing, and from your music library. Each app had advantages over the others in certain aspects. For example, creating a playlist from the playlist menu on Apple Music is much less ambiguous than creating a playlist from the menu on Spotify. Apple Music is very blunt with it's creation functions, clearly stating "New Playlist..." on the button itself, while Spotify requires an ambiguous "Edit" function prior to the actual creation.</p>

                    <a href="img/vroombox/badflow.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-title="" data-gallery="analysis" data-footer="Spotify, on the other hand, requires an 'Edit' button, which can confuse users. It also requires an extra click in order to create a playlist.">

                </div>
                <p>Small interruptions in user flow like this were things we made sure to keep in mind when developing our playlist creation functions. After our 9 scenario comparisons, we found that Spotify and Apple Music are very similar in many aspects. They deliberately try not to stray too far from the norms in an effort to maintain a solid mental model. Meanwhile, SoundCloud contains several innovative functions that are unclear at first, but cater to the expert user. With these ideas in mind, we scoped our design goal to be innovative, yet, intuitive. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRwHzuuYjgw2kXBTQpZ2Gz72hHQi9UBtTWcZBhZjleDTMtIdST-tvU4Vq3XYgamffDfeMvAOGulEqe0/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g35f391192_00">If you want to read more into our comparisons, you can see them here.</a></p>

                <p>Next, we dove into analyzing the information architecture of these 3 apps. We found numerous similarities, such as the static navbar, the curated playlists, genres, and search functions. Choices expand each time you dive deeper into the architecture. At the first level, there are the most popular choices, and as you move to the second and third level, selections begin to get more specific, branching into specific genres. This really helped us discover what other apps thought were the most important functions, things that could be reached within a few clicks.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>The purpose of this project was mainly to give us informal practice on research and prototyping. A simple recreation of these apps would have sufficed, but we wanted to make something unique, with a purpose. We revisited our research notes and the data that really struck a bell with us was the amount of young adults that use their phone to play music while driving. In the modern-era, just holding a phone is extremely dangerous. There are studies that prove that simple conversation, even with someone physically in the car, impairs driving ability. So we reframed our challenge to be, <b>how might we create a music streaming app that allows drivers to more safely control their music playlists?</b></p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>We analyzed our user needs and decided that an app of this sort would need to give high accuracy, feedback through senses other than vision, and easy navigation. We really wanted to emphasize usability without the need for visual feedback. Spotify does a good job of this, by providing a distinct sound when the skip button is pressed. We focused on utilizing swipe gestures to navigate previous and next and <b>limiting the number</b> of buttons and <b>prioritizing the size</b> of them to provide better tactile acuity. In an effort reduce information on the first layer, we decided to simplify the bottom nav bar to have only 3 options: Home, Search, and Library. This gives drivers less options, while being able to easily select their desired play mode. Lastly, we took heavy influence from Spotifys home page. We wanted a function that allowed users to resume the playlist they were previously listening to. For example, say the user is listening to a playlist, parks at a restaurant, eats, then gets back in the car. They can easily resume their playlist by clicking the "Jump Back In" function on the home screen.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We took these ideas and sketched out what they would look like on an app. After paper prototyping, we converted our sketches to digital mockups. We came up with an unconventional look, due to the enlarged buttons (and our lack of tehnical skill), but what we were focusing on was the functionality.</p>

                <p>The final deliverable for our project was an InVision prototype of our wireframes. We tested it with some fellow college students, and they recorded high accuracy in pressing the buttons we asked, leading us to believe that this app could succeed in the real world.</p>

                <p>Our top user needs focused on using senses other than vision to navigate the app, thus we focused on touch and hearing. I think that ideas like this will become prominent in the near future, and if this app were to ever become a reality, I would love to be able to add voice controls, thus allowing people to drive with both hands on the wheel, and eyes on the road.</p>

               This was one of my very first design projects, and I'm quite proud of it. Although my visual design and branding skills were pretty bad at the time, the thought process and concepts we came up with were unique and important, earning us the top score in the class. It is a fact that people use their phones far too much when it comes to driving. Using your phone while driving is proven to increase the rate of accidents, and although any kind of phone use is bad, stealing your visual attention is the worst. I think a lot more apps will take into consideration safety in the future.
