                Brief
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>This was my final project for a usability and information architecture course. In groups of 4, we were tasked with redesigning any particular user flow in a travel app or website. After downloading and testing several different apps, we found that Amtrak would be the most challenging to redesign due to the mere amount of information that needed to be available.</p>
                <p>In this project, I was responsible for user research, conducting a competitive analysis, ideation, wireframing, and prototyping.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>Initially, we wanted to look at as many travel apps as we could, and set aside the particularly good and bad ones. We scoped this down by downloading apps with high and low ratings on the app store. Then, we looked into what made the app so good or bad. We found that the good ones had a simplistic checkout process, while the bad ones were overly complicated. The worst one we found was the Amtrak app. They attempted to fit every single detail into the surface level of the app, so we wanted to add structure to the information architecture.</p>
                
                <p>We wanted to gain some initial insights to guide our research, so we started off by interviewing people who:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have used Amtrak before</li>
                    <li>Have <b>not</b> used Amtrak before</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>We also tested the Amtrak app by having both groups guide us through their checkout thought process. The people who had used Amtrak before did not rely on the app for anything other than booking the cheapest, fastest trip from Point A to Point B. The rest of the information, such as amenities, were just an extra benefit that they would discover once they were aboard the train. On the other hand, the first time users were exceedingly confused by the information shown without descriptions. When looking for things such as wifi capabilities and restrooms, they found icons with no legend or key to inform them what they meant. They were especially confused when required to transfer trains on a trip. Ironically, all of the interviewees had used other travel apps before (Lyft, Uber, Southwest Airlines, Airbnb), and thought that those were much easier to understand.</p>

                </div>
                <p>A majority of our interviewees claimed that they primarily fly with Southwest Airlines, because it is the cheapest getting around the west coast, where they reside. Unfortunately, the Southwest app is only rated 3/5 stars on the app store. For this reason, we chose to use the Southwest app as a baseline, and compare it to an extremely popular flight watching app, Hopper. Hopper utilizes color and a simple layout that makes everything intuitive and easy to comprehend, while Southwest uses a straightforward design with many prompts. Although Hopper has better reviews, this may be due to the fact that it simply has less information to display, as it requires less user inputs. Nonetheless, we found that both of the apps share similar characteristics in the booking process, such as choosing travel dates through the view of a calendar.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>Our professor specifically chose travel apps because of the inherent amount of information the user might need, but how did the other apps get away with such a clean look? We reviewed the apps again, and saw that they hid information behind a few clicks. By categorizing things and putting them a few clicks away, they create a longer, yet, clearer flow for the user. Valuing a rapid flow versus a clearer one was hard, but from our interviews, we found that a short, confusing flow sometimes took longer to comprehend anyways. So we moved forward asking the question: <b>How might we reorganize the information without deleting it or interrupting a natural user flow?</b></p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
                <p>We decided that we could separate the information into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, and thus have a cleaner surface level presentation. For example, some of the primary pieces of information were travel time, price, and destination. Secondary information would be amenities, and tertiary information would be in depth descriptions of said amenities.</p>
                <p>Another thing we noticed that other apps did was use graphical representations for information. Amtrak tried to use iconography to explain its amenities, but they failed by using unorthodox icons with no descriptions. We didn't want to use icons <i>just</i> to use icons. We wanted graphics for concepts that are easier explained with imagery than with words, such as the booking calendar and trip timeline.</p>

                <p>We began with some information architecture analysis and rough sketches of our main ideas. After paper prototyping, we converted our sketches to digital mockups. We ended up creating two extremely different versions, one more based off of Southwest (mine) and another of Hopper (my teammates). We wanted to test the amount of information we could show on the surface level, so the Southwest-style had more information, while Hopper-style was extremely minimal.</p>

                <p>The final deliverable for our project were two InVision prototypes; one of each set of mockups. We tested both prototypes and most people found tht the Hopper-style was easier to navigate, but the Southwest-style provided more information. Below are some of the wireframes that I created.

                <p>Our top user needs focused on ease of access to information in a timely manner. We wanted people to be able to find what they wanted to know in an intuitive way, and we succeeded in doing so, although our prototypes were not pretty. It takes a lot of effort to organize large amounts of information in a modern, minimalistic fashion.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-9 description">
               During this project, the amount of information was unlike anything anyone in our group had dealt with before. We didn't want to have to get rid of anything, so the challenge persisted. This one was a real big challenge, but reflecting on it now, I think my visual design had gotten a lot better, and my information architecture understanding has also come a long way. This also made me realize what a pain travel apps can be, but how rewarding creating a beautiful one must feel.
